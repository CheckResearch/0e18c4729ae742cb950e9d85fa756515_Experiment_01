  <dc:title>Experiment for ""schizophrene" und "polyglotte" Dateien"</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Reproduction of the work in ""schizophrene" und "polyglotte" Dateien" by "Cem Bicer"</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>In this experiment I demonstrate to you how file format hacks can lead to so called "schizophrenic" files and file "polyglots".

"Schizophrenic" files are files that show different outputs when opened with different parsers. They are crafted by merging two files with the same file format into a single file. Some parsers show the first file content some the other.

"Polyglot" files are files that merge two or more different file formats into one valid file which can be openend with parsers that support at least one of the merged formats. Depending on the parser the file identifies as a different file type.

Execute the main.py script to run all proof of concepts (PoCs).

All PoCs present in this experiment are adopted from Ange Albertini's ["Funky File Formats"](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/system/attachments/2562/original/Funky_File_Formats.pdf).</dc:description>
